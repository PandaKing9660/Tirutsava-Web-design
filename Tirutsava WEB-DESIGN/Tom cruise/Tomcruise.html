    <strong>
      Early Life
    </strong>
    Thomas Cruise Mapother IV was born on July 3, 1962, in Syracuse, New York, to electrical engineer Thomas Cruise Mapother
     III (1934–1984) and special education teacher Mary Lee (née Pfeiffer; 1936–2017). His parents were both from Louisville,
      Kentucky, and had English, German, and Irish ancestry. Cruise has three sisters named Lee Anne, Marian, and Cass. One of his
       cousins, William Mapother, is also an actor who has appeared alongside Cruise in five films. Cruise grew up in near poverty
        and had a Catholic upbringing. He later described his father as "a merchant of chaos", a "bully", and a "coward" who beat 
        his children. He elaborated, "[My father] was the kind of person where, if something goes wrong, they kick you. It was a great 
        lesson in my life—how he'd lull you in, make you feel safe and then, bang! For me, it was like, 'There's something wrong with 
        this guy. Don't trust him. Be careful around him.'"

Cruise spent part of his childhood in Canada. When his father took a job as a defense consultant with the Canadian Armed Forces,
 his family moved in late 1971 to Beacon Hill, Ottawa. He attended the new Robert Hopkins Public School for his fourth and fifth 
 grade education. He first became involved in drama in fourth grade, under the tutelage of George Steinburg. He and six other boys
  put on an improvised play to music called IT at the Carleton Elementary School drama festival. Drama organizer Val Wright, who was
   in the audience, later said that "the movement and improvisation were excellent  it was a classic ensemble piece". In sixth grade,
    Cruise went to Henry Munro Middle School in Ottawa. That year, his mother left his father, taking Cruise and his sisters back to
     the United States. In 1978, she married Jack South. Cruise's father died of cancer in 1984. Cruise briefly took a church scholarship
      and attended a Franciscan seminary in Cincinnati, Ohio; he aspired to become a priest before he became interested in acting.
       In total, he attended 15 schools in 14 years.

      Career 
    </strong>

    At age 18, with the blessing of his mother and stepfather, Cruise moved to New York City to pursue an acting career. After working 
    as a busboy in New York, he went to Los Angeles to try out for television roles. He signed with CAA and began acting in films.
     He first appeared in a bit part in the 1981 film Endless Love, followed by a major supporting role as a crazed military academy
      student in Taps later that year. In 1983, Cruise was part of the ensemble cast of The Outsiders. That same year he appeared in 
      All the Right Moves and Risky Business, which has been described as "A Generation X classic, and a career maker for Tom Cruise".
       He also played the male lead in the Ridley Scott film Legend, released in 1985. By 1986's Top Gun, his status as a superstar 
       cemented.

    Cruise followed up Top Gun with The Color of Money, which came out the same year, and which paired him with Paul Newman. 1988
     saw him star in Cocktail, which earned him a nomination for the Razzie Award for Worst Actor. Later that year he starred with 
     Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man, which won the Academy Award for Best Film and Cruise the Kansas City Film Critics Circle Award for
      Best Supporting Actor. Cruise portrayed real-life paralyzed Vietnam War veteran Ron Kovic in 1989's Born on the Fourth of July
      , which earned him a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Drama, the Chicago Film Critics Association Award for 
      Best Actor, the People's Choice Award for Favorite Motion Picture Actor, a nomination for BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a 
      Leading Role, and Cruise's first Best Actor Academy Award nomination.
    In 2003, he starred in Edward Zwick's period action drama The Last Samurai, for which he received a Golden Globe nomination for
     best actor. In 2004, Cruise received critical acclaim for his performance as Vincent in Collateral, directed by Michael Mann. 
     In 2005, Cruise worked again with Steven Spielberg in War of the Worlds, a loose adaptation of the H. G. Wells novel of the same 
     name, which became the fourth highest-grossing film of the year with US$591.4 million worldwide. Also in 2005, he won the People's
      Choice Award for Favorite Male Movie Star and the MTV Generation Award. Cruise was nominated for seven Saturn Awards between 2002 
      and 2009, winning once. Nine of the ten films he starred in during the decade made over $100 million at the box office.

    In 2006, he returned to his role as Ethan Hunt in the third installment of the Mission Impossible film series, Mission: Impossible 
    III. The film was more positively received by critics than the previous films in the series, and grossed nearly $400 million at
     the box office. In 2007, Cruise took a rare supporting role for the second time in Lions for Lambs, which was a commercial
      disappointment. This was followed by an unrecognizable appearance as "Les Grossman" in the 2008 comedy Tropic Thunder with Ben 
      Stiller, Jack Black, and Robert Downey Jr. This performance earned Cruise a Golden Globe nomination. Cruise played the central
       role in the historical thriller Valkyrie released on December 25, 2008 to box office success.

    In March 2010, Cruise completed filming the action-comedy Knight and Day, in which he re-teamed with former costar Cameron Diaz;
     the film was released on June 23, 2010. On February 9, 2010, Cruise confirmed that he would star in Mission: Impossible – 
     Ghost Protocol, the fourth installment in the Mission: Impossible series. The film was released in December 2011 to high 
     critical acclaim and box office success. Unadjusted for ticket price inflation, it was Cruise's biggest commercial success to
      that date

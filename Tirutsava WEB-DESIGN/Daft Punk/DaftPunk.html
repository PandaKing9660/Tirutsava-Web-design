  Hey, I got to know about Daft Punk because of a collaboration song with Weeknd and called StarBoy. This is an absolutely
  amazing song, then i did some research on the music composers i.e. Daft Punk and found out that 
  Daft Punk are a French electronic music duo formed in Paris in 1993 by Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas
  Bangalter. They achieved popularity in the late 1990s as part of the French house movement; they also had
  success in the years following, combining elements of house music with funk, techno, disco, rock and
  synthpop.They have worn ornate helmets and gloves to assume robot personas in most public appearances since
  1999 and rarely grant interviews or appear on television. The duo were managed from 1996 to 2008 by Pedro Winter
  (also known as Busy P), the head of Ed Banger Records.

  <strong>
    Early Life
  </strong>
  <br>
  Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter met in 1987 while attending the Lycée Carnot secondary school in
  Paris.The two became friends and recorded demos with others from the school. This led to the formation of a
  guitar-based group called Darlin' with Laurent Brancowitz in 1992. Bangalter and Homem-Christo played bass and guitar,
  respectively, while Brancowitz was brought on board after the two sought an additional guitarist.The trio had
  branded themselves after The Beach Boys song of the same name, which they covered along with an original composition.
  Both tracks were released on a multi-artist EP under Duophonic Records, a label owned by the London-based band
  Stereolab, who invited the trio to open for stage shows in the United Kingdom.Bangalter felt that "The rock n' roll
  thing we did was pretty average, I think. It was so brief, maybe six months, four songs and two gigs and that was
  it." A negative review in Melody Maker by Dave Jennings subsequently dubbed the music "a daft punky thrash."
  Instead of dismissing the review, they found it amusing. As Homem-Christo stated, "We struggled so long to find [the
  name] Darlin', and this happened so quickly."Darlin' soon disbanded, leaving Brancowitz to pursue other efforts
  with Phoenix. Bangalter and Homem-Christo formed Daft Punk and experimented with drum machines and synthesisers.

    Career

  <br>
  Daft Punk worked on their fourth studio album, Random Access Memories, with musicians including Paul Williams, Chic
  frontman Nile Rodgers, and Giorgio Moroder. In January 2013, Homem-Christo revealed that Daft
  Punk was in the process of signing with Sony Music Entertainment through the Columbia Records label, and that the album
  would have a spring release.A gradual promotional rollout was later launched featuring billboards and television
  spots, leading to the reveal of the album title and the release date of 21 May 2013. On 3 April, the official
  Random Access Memories website launched The Collaborators, a series of documentary videos about the album. Later
  that month, a video preview for the song "Get Lucky" featuring Rodgers and Pharrell Williams was played at the 2013
  Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. The radio edit of the song was released as a digital download single one
  week later on 19 April 2013."Get Lucky" became Daft Punk's first UK No. 1 single on 28 April 2013 remaining at
  number one for 4 weeks (as of 24 May) and the Spotify music streaming website reported that the song is the
  most-streamed new song in the service's history.At the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards, Daft Punk debuted a trailer for
  their single "Lose Yourself to Dance," and presented the award for "Best Female Video" alongside Rodgers and
  Pharrell. In December, the duo revealed a music video for the song "Instant Crush," directed by Warren Fu and
  featuring Julian Casablancas.

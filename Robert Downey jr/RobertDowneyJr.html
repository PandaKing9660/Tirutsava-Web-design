  "I am IRONMAN", this line just made everyone cry on their seats when avengers endgame came out.
  and we all know who was the reason, Ironman for sure. As much as we love the character we should
  also appriciate it's actor Robert Jhon Downey Jr. .he was born on April 4, 1965. And he is an American actor and producer.
  His career has been characterized by critical and popular success in his youth, followed by a period of substance abuse and legal troubles, 
  before a resurgence of commercial success in middle age. In 2008, Downey was named by Time magazine among the 100 most
  influential people in the world, and from 2013 to 2015, he was listed by Forbes as Hollywood's highest-paid
  actor. His films have grossed over $14.4 billion worldwide, making Downey the sixth-highest-grossing box office
  star of all-time.

  <strong>
    Early Life
  </strong>
  <br>
  At the age of five, he made his acting debut in Robert Downey Sr.'s film Pound in 1970. He subsequently worked with the
  Brat Pack in the teen films Weird Science (1985) and Less Than Zero (1987). In 1992, Downey portrayed the title
  character in the biopic Chaplin, for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor and won a BAFTA Award.
  Following a stint at the Corcoran Substance Abuse Treatment Facility on drug charges, he joined the TV series Ally
  McBeal, for which he won a Golden Globe Award; however in the wake of two drug charges, one in late 2000 and one in
  early 2001, he was fired and his character terminated. He stayed in a court-ordered drug treatment program shortly after
  and has maintained his sobriety since 2003.
  <br>
  Downey gained global recognition for starring as Tony Stark / Iron Man in ten films within the Marvel Cinematic
  Universe, beginning with Iron Man (2008). He has also played the title character in Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes
  (2009), which earned him his second Golden Globe, and its sequel, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (2011).

  <strong>
    Career
  </strong>
  <br>
  In 2007, Downey was cast as the title character in the film Iron Man, with director Jon Favreau explaining the
  choice by stating: "Downey wasn't the most obvious choice, but he understood what makes the character tick. He found a
  lot of his own life experience in 'Tony Stark'."Favreau insisted on having Downey as he repeatedly claimed that
  Downey would be to Iron Man what Johnny Depp is to the Pirates of the Caribbean series: a lead actor who could both
  elevate the quality of the film and increase the public's interest in it. For the role Downey had to
  gain more than 20 pounds (9 kilograms) of muscle in five months to look like he "had the power to forge iron".
  
  Iron Man was globally released between April 30 and May 3, 2008, grossing over $585 million worldwide and receiving
  rave reviews which cited Downey's performance as a highlight of the film. By October 2008, Downey had agreed
  to appear as Iron Man in two Iron Man sequels, as part of the Iron Man franchise, as well as The Avengers, featuring the
  superhero team that Stark joins, based on Marvel's comic book series The Avengers. He first reprised the role in a
  small appearance as Iron Man's alter ego Tony Stark in the 2008 film The Incredible Hulk, as a part of Marvel Studios'
  depicting the same Marvel Universe on film by providing continuity among the movies.
